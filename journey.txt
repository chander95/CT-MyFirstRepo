My favorite Coding Temple moment was when I relaized I was 25% completed with the software engineering course and I managed to remember enough basic python to figure out 3 CodeWars exercised relatively quickly. This equipped me with the confidence and realization that I can do this and although it will take work, the work is fun and keeps my brain busy the way I need.
